## Running unit tests ##

To run unit tests, you'll have to install vendors:

    ./bin/install_vendors.sh

Once done, build fixtures:

    ./tests/reset_tests.sh

Now you can run unit tests for both `Generator/` and `Runtime/`:

    phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist tests/Propel/Tests/Generator/

    phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist tests/Propel/Tests/Runtime/
